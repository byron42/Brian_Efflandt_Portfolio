      <title>Full Stack Weather App (MERN)</title>

      <description>MERN application that grabs an openweather API and stores the JSON in MongoDB. There is also a function that stores a timestamp for each submit in local storage that can be cleared from within the app.
As of right now only US zips are readable because of the API, but I would like to rework this in the future so that it accesses the geolocation API (enter city name). For now this is functional and running error free.</description>

      <description>Getting this app up and running isn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done. That being said, this Django app allows a user to enter text into a textarea which is then processed by the googletrans API, and then returns the translation from the previously selected language.</description>

      <description>For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken this React tutorial and added a method to highlight the winning column, and also enhanced the interface for a better look and feel (clean, responsive).</description>

      <description>Advanced web-dev semester long project (refactored) which included wire frames, marketing concepts, color scheming, search engine optimization, software development life cycle, and time management concepts. The whole project involved sharing ideas with other classmates throughout the semester, and sharing constructive criticism about other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas and workflows.
Notes:
Bootstrap, JavaScript, SDLC, SEO, wire framing</description>

      <description>Creating this site has been a big challenge, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned volumes in the process. It&amp;rsquo;s given me more experience in all areas of SDLC, especially in the deployment and bug tracking area (organizing repositories and subdirectories with git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages).
I found a theme that fit my eye for displaying my content the way I saw it in my mind and then went to work. All the content menus and items were custom built by me, and honestly the only thing that remains of the original theme is the layout design to some extent&amp;hellip;</description>
